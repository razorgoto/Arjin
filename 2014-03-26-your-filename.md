It was snowing.

I knew it was a bad idea to get into his car. As soon as he brushed off the snow, he reached over to me, on the passenger side, and opened the glove compartment. A bottle -- clear and gold.

“You want some?” Arjin asked.

I shook my head to the bottle of Barcardi.

He took a long draw from the mickey and swished it in his mouth mouth -- left and right -- then gargled the back of his throat before swallowing.

It was 9:30 at night. There was snow -- wet snow -- on everything. I wanted to go home. Normally I take the bus, but today the weather was so horrible and tomorrow I am suppose to be here early. I asked Arjin for a ride.

Arjin was the guy who sits by himself at the side of the warehouse during lunch. He was a nice guy: we all liked him when we understood him. He mumbled or slurred, or maybe he stuttered.

We rolled over the wide curved lane that lead to our industrial park from the main road. He snorted a little still from the grey soot of the propane forklifts. The skinny little wheels on his Suisuki Swift skidded slightly around the banks. On the left turn onto Airport Road we almost did a donut. Arjin didn’t seem to noticed that his little car almost flipped over.

“So,” Arjin turns his whole attention to me, “what do they have you doing these days?” We were doing 80 and skipping over the white cub van and the unhitched long haul cabs. I don’t know if Arjin saw them as he was cutting them off, narrowly almost slicing of there side mirrors. I answered by clutching hard onto the grey plastic door handle.

“Have to buy something,” he said, “you mind if we stop.”

Who am I to mind? I am getting a free ride. I nodded.

We hopped out at a little store on Airport and Derry that sold paan, Hindi DVD’s, and tobbacco. Arjin cocked his head slowly at the clerk and asked for a packet of smokeless tobbaco. It came in a green package with a picture of a light skinned man with an impossibly white smile. Arjin tore it open with his teeth and popped a little with plastic pellet, almost like a small pillow, into his mouth.

“Can I try one,” I asked.

He handed me one. “Like this,” he flipped his upper lip with his forefinger and thumb to show me the placement of the pillow resting between his gums. I imitated his fingers and mouth and the spicy peppermint stung my mouth. It soothed. It burned. I felt the relief of nicotine washing over.

We continued driving. The snow was letting up a bit as we turned on Derry. We passed the tenaments on the left side and turned just pass the McDonald’s on to the 427. The snow was letting up in the highway light. People were still driving too slowly. We passed the cars with the hemy engines in our little two cyclinder.

“When are you moving?” He asked.
“Brampton?”
“Yeah.”
“I don’t know. Rent is too expensive for what it is here.”
“Yeah, you should come by where I am. It’s nice. Close to the the station. You’re not making much, huh?”
“No.”

A Mercedes was sitting on the shoulders with its four-ways on.

“It’s been ok. I get by.”
“It’s ok,” Arjin said, “you are a young guy. You’re don’t have family right? Not married?”

I forced a very embarassed laugh. “Gawd, no.”
“That’s ok. You will soon.”
I looked at him. “How many kids do you have?”
“Two: a boy -- he is twenty-one and a daughter. Fourteen.”
“They live with you?”
“Of course, only stupid Canadians wants to move out when they’re 18. I tell him, ‘You live here, you can do whatever you like. You a grown man now. But you can save some money and buy a house later.’ He is a smart kid. He knows I speak truth.”
“Wait, your kid is 21. How old are you?”
“I don’t look so old, huh.”
No, he doesn’t look so old.
“I got married when I was twenty-one. My wife was sixteen. Her parents were very religious -- Portugese. They took one look at me and thought it was bad.”
“What are you?”
“I’m from India.”
“You Catholic?”
“No, Sikh. No, not anything. But my father.”
“Sikh -- like Sirinder?”
“Yeah, he is from the same place I am.”
“Your kids? They speak? Um ...”
“No, they don’t know Punjabi. I speak Punjabi, Erdu, a little bit Hindi.”
“Your wife?”
“She learned, but we never taught the kids. They don’t need to know.”
“They can later, right?”
“Nah, they won’t want to.”
